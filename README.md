## Hello there 👋
I’m Ravi Teja Gonnabathula, a Data Scientist & AI/ML Engineer focused on building **LLM-powered systems**, **RAG agents**, and **end-to-end analytics solutions**.  

I’ve worked across **data science, business analytics, and ML engineering**, deploying models to production, building scalable data pipelines, and creating dashboards that drive real business decisions. I earned my **Master’s in Information Technology & Management (Data Science)** from **UT Dallas** and have 5+ years of experience across analytics, ML, and data platforms.

In my prior roles, I’ve:
- Built and deployed predictive ML models (classification, forecasting, NLP) using **Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Spark**.  
- Designed **data workflows on AWS** and other cloud platforms (ETL, feature pipelines, model serving).  
- Developed **dashboards in Power BI / Tableau** that tie ML outputs to actionable KPIs for stakeholders.  


### What I’m Working On
- 🔭 **LLMs, RAG, and Agents:**  
  Experimenting with **RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, and domain-specific copilots** (e.g., invoice understanding, document Q&A, and credit-risk assistants).
- 🧠 **ML & MLOps:**  
  Building **end-to-end ML workflows** — from data prep and feature engineering to model deployment and monitoring.
- 📊 **Analytics & BI:**  
  Designing **SQL + BI** solutions that connect raw data to narratives for stakeholders (Power BI / Tableau / Snowflake / Redshift).
- 🧪 **Hands-on Projects:**  
  - Credit risk & loan payback prediction  
  - Invoice extraction + Q&A using OCR + LayoutLM/RAG  
  - Poker tracking & analytics app (AllInBank)  
  - Kaggle notebooks (EDA → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation)

### Outside of Work
- 📚 I explore research and blogs on **LLMs, RAG, AI agents, prompt engineering, and causal inference**, then try to **implement the ideas in code** instead of just reading.  
- 🏆 I enjoy participating in **Kaggle competitions** and building public notebooks and GitHub projects that showcase clean, readable, and production-aware code.  
- 🎯 I’m building a personal “DIY MBA” through case studies, essays, and real-world data projects in **finance and retail analytics**.
